# Summary

`MiniSom` is a minimalistic and Numpy based implementation of the Self Organizing Maps (SOM). SOM is a type of Artificial Neural Network able to convert complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data items into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display.


# Statement of need 

SOM is a well known type of Neural Network [kohonen1990self]. Since the first formulation, it became a tool in a plethora of applications in many scientific fields.  The Machine Learning community has not only found numerous applications for it but has developed a staggering amount of variants of the original model.

`MiniSom` is a Python library that implements SOM and it is designed to be easy to modify and adapt. The goal is to give researchers the ability to easily create variants of the main SOM model and give students an implementation of SOM which is easy to understand.

`Minisom` has already been currently cited in many academic documents including scientific publications and theses. It has been used in many typical Machine Learning applications, as time series modeling [@fortuin2018som] and text mining [@makiyama2015text]. And it has also been using in other fields as Geophysics [@lessin2020modeling] and Climatology [@thompson2020synoptic]. Also, `MiniSom` has been used for the creation of teaching materials on Machine Learning. See [@lisbonuni] for an example of didactic material made using `MiniSom`.

The interface of `MiniSom` has evolved to blend easily with the general Machine Learning frameworks `scikit-learn` [@pedregosa2011scikit] and the visualization library `matplotlib` [@matplotlib].

The library was originally developed while working a Machine Learning methodology to embed structured data (graphs and trees) into vectorial spaces [@vettigli2017fuzzy].
